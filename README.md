# displaydat
This is a, not functioning yet, simple display board we are making to see if we can make something interesting.  I have old screens that are begging for something like this in my home.

# Installation instructions
Get the computer you want to install it on, and dust it off.  It should be running in such a way to display something on the screen.  I suppose you could set this up with a tablet as well with a computer hosting the site.

    sudo apt install python3
    sudo apt install flask
    cd displaydat/application
    flask --app dashboard run --host=0.0.0.0

Have fun.

# Frequently asked questions:
